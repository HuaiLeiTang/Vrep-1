V-REP is the Swiss army knife among robot simulators: you won't find a simulator with more functions, features, or more <a href="apisOverview.htm">elaborate APIs</a>.</p>
<p>The robot simulator V-REP, with integrated development environment, is based on a distributed control architecture: each object/model can be individually controlled via an embedded script, a plugin, a ROS node, a remote API client, or a custom solution. This makes V-REP very versatile and ideal for multi-robot applications. Controllers can be written in C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Urbi.</p>
<p>Following are just a few of V-REP's applications:</p>
<li>Simulation of factory automation systems</li>
<li>Remote monitoring</li>
<li>Hardware control</li>
<li>Fast prototyping and verification</li>
<li>Safety monitoring</li>
<li>Fast algorithm development</li>
<li>Robotics related education</li>
<li>Product presentation</li>

<p>
V-REP can be used as a stand-alone application or can easily be embedded into a main client application: its small footprint and elaborate API makes V-REP an ideal candidate to embed into higher-level applications. An integrated Lua script interpreter makes V-REP an extremely versatile application, leaving the freedom to the user to combine the low/high-level functionalities to obtain new high-level functionalities.

A good way to get a quick start with V-REP is to have a look at the <a href="tutorials.htm">tutorial section</a> first.
