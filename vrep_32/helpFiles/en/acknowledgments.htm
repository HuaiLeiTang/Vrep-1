Acknowledgments and credits
</h1>

<p>
V-REP was developed during several years, however, without the contributions, help, support, advice, or generosity of many people, it wouldn't have become what it is today. I wish to thank and acknowledge the contributions in various forms of the following people, group of people or organizations:
