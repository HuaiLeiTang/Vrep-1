Compiling V-REP and related items
</h1>

<p>
The full source code of V-REP, the DYNAMICS PLUGIN, the MESH CALCULATION PLUGIN and the PATH PLANNING PLUGIN may be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.coppeliarobotics.com">coppelia robotics website</a>.  In short, only EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES (students, teachers, professors, schools or Universities) may do so. Make sure you understand and comply with the <a href="licensing.htm">licensing conditions</a> before doing so.</p>
<p>Other source code items (e.g. various projects, plugins, interfaces, etc.) that are included in the installation packages of V-REP PRO and V-REP PRO EDU are not discussed here.</p>
<p>V-REP, the DYNAMICS PLUGIN, the MESH CALCULATION PLUGIN and the PATH PLANNING PLUGIN are <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a> projects, and will require you to have Qt installed on your computer.  Try to comply with following list of requirements in order to encounter least problems during compilation:</p>

<li>if possible, try using the same Qt version as the one that was used to compile the binary V-REP PRO EDU (click [Help --&gt; About V-REP PRO EDU...] to display the Qt version)</li>
<li>if possible, try compiling the projects using <a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator">Qt Creator</a>.</li>
<li>under Windows, use the MinGW or the MSVC compiler. Under Mac OSX and Linux, use the GCC compiler.</li>
<li>Ubuntu is the preferred Linux distribution.</li>
<li>you will need to download and compile <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla/intro">QScintilla</a> (C++ editor control). </li>
<li>you will need to download and install the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost C++ library</a>. </li>
<li>you will need to download the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua5.1</a> binaries and headers. </li>

<p>Download and install V-REP PRO EDU. Then download the V-REP source code (and optionally the plugin source codes) into the V-REP PRO EDU installation folder. You should have following folder structure:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/folderStructure.jpg"></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using V-REP in conjunction with a plugin, make sure to use the source code / binaries that come from the same release, in order to avoid incompatibilities. Finally, before being able to compile the V-REP project, you will have to adjust various paths in the  v_rep.pro project file, such as:</p>



<li>the path to your Boost library folder</li>
<li>the path to your QScintilla/Qt4 folder</li>
<li>the path to your QScintilla folder</li>
<li>the path to your Lua5.1 folder</li>
<li>the location of your lua5.1 library file</li>
<li>the location of your libqscintilla2 library file</li>
 
<p>When compiling V-REP under Windows, you might have to place a copy of the precompiled header (<em>vrepPrecompiledHeader.h</em>) into the release folder, to avoid having the compiler complaining.</p>
